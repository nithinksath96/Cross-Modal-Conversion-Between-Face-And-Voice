# Cross-Modal-Conversion-Between-Face-And-Voice
Humans are able to imagine a person's voice from the person's appearance and imagine the person's appearance from his/her voice.This may indicate the possibility of being a certain correlation between voices and appearance. Here we try to solve this interesting question whether it is technically possible to predict the voice of a person only from an image of his/her face and predict a personâ€™s face only from his/her voice. Our method aims to convert speech into a voice that matches an input face image and generate a face image that matches the voice of the input speech by leveraging the underlying correlation between faces and voices.
